Hi, I am Rezoanoor Rahman; currently doing my PhD in statistics at the Ohio State University (https://stat.osu.edu/).

Prior to that, I worked as an AI Research scientist at Robi Axiata Limited (https://www.robi.com.bd/en), which is the second largest telco operator in Bangladesh.
I completed my BS and MS in Applied Statistics from ISRT, University of Dhaka (https://www.isrt.ac.bd/).

My prior research interest is on the field of Machine Learning and Time-Series data analysis.
