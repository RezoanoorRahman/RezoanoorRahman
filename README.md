Hi, I am Rezoanoor Rahman; currently doing my PhD in statistics at the Ohio State University (https://stat.osu.edu/).

Prior to that, I worked as an AI Research scientist at Robi Axiata Limited (https://www.robi.com.bd/en) where I worked on different predictive models for effective campaign managemnent. During that time, I worked with different programming languages like R and Python. I also used SQL as a query language and Apache Spark (PySpark) for large-scale data processing.


I completed my BS and MS in Applied Statistics from ISRT, University of Dhaka (https://www.isrt.ac.bd/).
